- Telegram Bot

## Installation

First, please clone and install this project via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer create-project lbiltech/telegram-bot-github-notify
```

After running the command above, you will have the project installed under the `telegram-bot-github-notify` directory,
and the environment file `.env` will be created automatically.

Some the json files will be created automatically in the `storage` directory.
These files are used to store the data and serve for features in this bot.
(You can change the storage directory in the `.env` file)

### Create a New Bot

To create a new bot, you need to talk to [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and follow a few simple steps.

1. Open a chat with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and send `/newbot` command.
2. Enter a friendly name for your bot. This name will be displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
3. Enter a unique username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: `TetrisBot` or `tetris_bot`.
4. Copy the HTTP API access token provided by [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and paste it into your `.env` file.

```shell
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```

### Get your Chat ID and add it to the .env file

1. Open a chat with your bot.
2. Send a message to your bot.
3. Go to the following URL: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates`
4. Look for the `"chat":{"id":` field and copy the number after it. This is your Chat ID.
5. Paste the Chat ID in your `.env` file.

```shell
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

### Set up your domain and SSL certificate

**You need to set up your domain and SSL certificate to use the webhook**. You can build your own server or use a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

In this example, we will use localhost and ngrok to set up the domain and webhook:
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Run command in terminal: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. Run command in terminal: `ngrok http 8000`
4. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and paste it into your `.env` file.

```shell
APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok.io
```

### Set the webhook

We have two ways to set the webhook:

#### 1. Set the webhook from this project

After setting up your domain and SSL certificate, you need to set up the webhook for your bot. Go to:

```text
<APP_URL>/webhook/set.php
```

> **Note:** Replace `<APP_URL>` with your app URL in .env file.

If you see the following message, it means that the webhook has been sent successfully.

```json
{"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"}
```

#### 2. Set the webhook manually from Telegram

If you want to set the webhook manually, you can use the following URL:

```url
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/setWebhook?url=<APP_URL>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<YourBOTToken>` with your bot token and `<APP_URL>` with your app URL in .env file.

### Add chat ids you want to receive notifications to the .env file

You can add multiple chat ids to the `.env` file. 

**These chat ids will be the chat ids of your groups, channels, or users.**

Also, you can add **the chat id of this bot** to receive incoming notifications for itself.

```shell
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113,-1001933979183"
```

> **Note:** Please use comma to separate chat ids.

---

Now your configuration is complete. And the `.env` file will be like this:

```shell
APP_NAME='Telegram Github Notify Bot'

# Set your app URL here
APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok.io

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=6162840106:AAH3g20lMQIkG_wHHu8R_ngdtG541uzoq4
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=6872320129

# Set your telegram group chat ids here ( please use comma to separate )
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113,-1001933979183"

TIMEZONE=Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh

PHP_VERSION_SELECTED=8.2
CONTAINER_NAME=telegram-notify-bot
APP_PORT=3180
```

## Usage

Now you can send a message to your bot, and you will receive a welcome message from the bot.

```text
/start
```

If you want to check the menu, you can send the following message to your bot.

```text
/menu
```

At this point, the configuration process for your telegram bot is completed. You can use all the features of this bot.

Now you will need to add the Webhook for your GitHub repository to receive notifications.

## Add webhook on your GitHub repository to receive notifications

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Go to the `Webhooks` section
3. Click on `Add webhook`
4. Set `Payload URL` to `<APP_URL>`
5. Set `Content type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
6. Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? Select `Let me select individual events.`
7. Click on the `Active` checkbox and Add webhook button.
8. Done. You will receive a notification when your repository has a new event.

Here is the first notification you will receive:

> **Note: You can set up this webhook for different repositories. Please similarly set up the webhook for each repository.**

Then every time one of those repositories appears an event, this telegram bot will immediately send you a notification.
